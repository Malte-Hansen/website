You can also try out our hosted demo instance : 1. Clone the deployment repo and cd into the correct directory git clone https://github.com/ExplorViz/deployment.git cd deployment/frontend-demo/ 2. Use docker compose to start the software stack. The frontend will run on port 8080 . You can change all ports in the (hidden) .env file. docker compose up -d 3.
